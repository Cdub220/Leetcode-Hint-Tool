# Leetcode Hint Tool

A Chrome extension that gives **gentle, step-by-step AI hints** for LeetCode problems — **without spoilers**. Stay in problem-solving mode while getting just enough guidance to unblock yourself.

> Works directly on `leetcode.com` problem pages. One click (or hotkey) → progressively deeper hints (nudge → approach → edge cases → complexity notes → optional code outline).

## Features

- **No-spoiler hints** in tiers (you choose how deep to go)
- **One-click** or **keyboard shortcuts** to open/advance hints
- **Understands the page**: auto-reads title, difficulty, tags, and constraints
- **Edge cases & test ideas** to nudge your thinking
- **Complexity tips** and common patterns (sliding window, two pointers, etc.)
- **History panel** to revisit previous hints
